## Description

Password Generator let's you generate a random password of your choice between 8 and 128 characters, it's letting you choose what kind of password you'd like to do. For example; it's letting you choose if you want to have upper case or lower case letter, numbers, symbols or all of the above into your password. If you choose less than 8 or more than 128 letters you will get prompt saying you have to choose between 8 or 128. If you do not choose any checkboxes, you will again get prompt saying you at least have to choose one of the checkboxes below.
